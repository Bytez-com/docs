| Paper | Summary | Link |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Phi-4-reasoning Technical Report** | Introduces Microsoft's Phi-4, a small-scale language model trained exclusively on high-quality synthetic and filtered web data. Despite its compact size, Phi-4 demonstrates strong reasoning abilities across benchmarks like MATH, GPQA, and StrategyQA, rivaling or surpassing much larger models. | [Interactive Paper →](https://bytez.com/docs/arxiv/2504.21318/paper) |
| **UniversalRAG** | Presents a unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework capable of retrieving and reasoning over diverse corpora spanning text, images, and structured data. It introduces modular retrievers and a Mixture-of-Experts reader to handle multimodal and multi-granular inputs, achieving strong performance across a range of tasks. | [Interactive Paper →](https://bytez.com/docs/arxiv/2504.20734/paper) |
| **Skywork R1V2** | Introduces a multimodal vision-language model trained using a hybrid of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a reward model tailored for reasoning tasks. The approach significantly improves performance on benchmarks like MMBench and MathVista, showcasing enhanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. | [Interactive Paper →](https://bytez.com/docs/arxiv/2504.16656/paper) |
| **Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video** | Proposes a learning-based framework to estimate and disentangle camera motion from scene dynamics in unconstrained videos. By modeling motion types and incorporating semantic priors, the method enhances video understanding across diverse real-world scenarios. | [Interactive Paper →](https://bytez.com/docs/arxiv/2504.15376/paper) |
| **The Leaderboard Illusion** | Critiques the AI community’s overreliance on benchmark leaderboards, showing that small changes in evaluation design can significantly alter perceived model rankings. The paper highlights how this illusion can misguide progress, calling for more robust and transparent evaluation practices. | [Interactive Paper →](https://bytez.com/docs/arxiv/2504.20879/paper) |
