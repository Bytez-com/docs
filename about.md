# About Us
## Our background

Bytez started as a community project out of [NeurIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems). Thank you, Lee Campbell, who believed in us during the idea stage. Thank you to the volunteers at [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), [CVPR](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/), and the entire ML community. Your support and your contributions are the foundation of Bytez and the future of open science.

## Our mission

The mission of Bytez is to make open source AI easy to discover, understand, and use.

We believe there is an opportunity to make open models as trusted and ready-to-use as closed models, to the benefit of all developers and researchers.
