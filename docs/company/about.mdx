## Our Story

Bytez started as a community project out of NeurIPS. Thank you, Lee Campbell, who believed in us during the idea stage. Thank you to the volunteers at NeurIPS, CVPR, and the entire ML community. Your support and your contributions are the foundation of Bytez and the future of open science.

## Our Mission

The mission of Bytez is to make open source AI easy to discover, understand, and use.

We believe there is an opportunity to make open models as trusted and ready-to-use as closed models, to the benefit of all developers and researchers.

We're building Bytez in the open, alongside the AI community. Join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Z723PfCFWf) or follow us on [X](https://x.com/Bytez) for the latest model releases and research insights.
