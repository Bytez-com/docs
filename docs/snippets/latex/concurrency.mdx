$$
  \text{Scaling policy to maintain} = \frac{\text{concurrent requests}}{\text{instance count}} = 1
$$

<br />

For example, if the load balancer detects that your traffic over time is:

<br />

$$
\frac{\text{2.1 concurrent requests}}{\text{1 instance}} = \text{ratio over 1} = \text{Needs to scale up   }
$$

$$
\frac{\text{3.5 concurrent requests}}{\text{5 instances}} = \text{ratio below 1} = \text{Needs to scale down}
$$
