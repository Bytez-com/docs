## Model API
The Bytez Model API gives you access to 40,000+ AI models across 33 ML tasks, including `text`, `image`, `audio generation`, and `chat`. It has a standard protocol for [`open-source`](/api-reference/open-source/run-open-source-model) and [`proprietary`](api-reference/closed-source/openai) models â€“ delivering GPU performance at CPU pricing.
