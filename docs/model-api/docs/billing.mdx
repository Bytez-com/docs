Bytez uses a credit-based system. Credits are consumed when you run models, and how they're consumed depends on whether you're using closed-source or open-source models.

## How Credits Work

Credits are a unified currency across all models on Bytez. When you run a model, credits are deducted from your balance based on usage.

| Model Type    | How Credits Are Consumed                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Closed models | Based on provider pricing (per token, per image, per video, etc.) |
| Open models   | Per second of inference                                           |

Your credits purchased in the last 4 weeks determine two things:

1. **Which open models you can access** - Larger open models require more credits purchased to unlock
2. **Your rate limits** - More credits purchased unlocks more concurrent requests

<Info>
  Adding credits immediately unlocks higher tiers. You don't need to wait for the next billing
  cycle.
</Info>

### Credit Unlock Thresholds

| Credits Purchased (last 4 weeks) | Open Model Access | Concurrent Requests (7B) |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| $0 (Free)                        | Up to 7B          | 1                        |
| $3+                              | Up to 7B          | 4                        |
| $10+                             | Up to 35B         | 4                        |
| $25+                             | Up to 70B         | 10                       |
| $50+                             | Up to 120B        | 20                       |
| $100+                            | Up to 120B        | 40                       |
| $500+                            | Up to 120B        | 200                      |
| $1,000+                          | Up to 120B        | 400                      |

<Warning>Credits expire 4 weeks after purchase. Use them or lose them!</Warning>

## Closed Model Billing

For closed-source models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Cohere), we pass through the provider's pricing plus a small platform fee.

```
Your cost = Provider price + 2% platform fee
```

Providers charge differently depending on the model and modality - per token for text, per image for image generation, per second for video, etc. We pass through whatever the provider charges.

**Example:** If OpenAI charges {`$0.000001`} per M tokens, you pay {`$0.00000102`} per M tokens.

<Accordion title="Why the 2% fee?">
  The platform fee covers:
  - Unified API translation and standardization
  - Request routing and load balancing
  - Usage tracking and analytics
  - Support and reliability infrastructure

You get a single API, single billing, and single format across all providers.

</Accordion>

### What's included

- **Pass-through pricing** - Pay only for what the provider charges
- **No minimum** - No monthly minimums or commitments
- **Real-time pricing** - We pass through provider rates as they change

---

## Open Model Billing

Open-source models run on our **serverless GPU infrastructure**. You're billed per second of inference time - no cold start fees, no idle charges.

```
Your cost = Inference time (seconds) x Rate for model size
```

### Pricing by Model Size

Bigger models use more VRAM, so they cost more per second:

| Model Size | Per Second | Per Hour |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 7B         | $0.000072  | ~$0.26   |
| 15B        | $0.000108  | ~$0.39   |
| 35B        | $0.000144  | ~$0.52   |
| 70B        | $0.000216  | ~$0.78   |
| 120B       | $0.00036   | ~$1.30   |

<Accordion title="How we calculate pricing">
  Our base rate is **$0.0000045/GB-second** of VRAM used.

For comparison:

- **Bytez:** $0.0000045/GB-sec (with Nvidia GPUs)
- **AWS Lambda:** $0.0000167/GB-sec (CPUs only)

That's **3.7x cheaper** than AWS Lambda, and you get serverless Nvidia GPUs, not just serverless CPUs.

</Accordion>

### What's included

- **Per-second billing** - Billed in 1-second increments
- **No cold start fees** - You don't pay while the model loads
- **No idle charges** - You don't pay when not running inference
- **No reserved instances** - No commitments, no minimums

## Auto-Reload

Auto-reload automatically tops up your credit balance when it runs low, so your API calls never fail unexpectedly.

### How it works

| Setting       | Default | Description                                   |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Threshold     | $3      | Reload triggers when balance drops below this |
| Reload amount | $10     | Amount added to your balance                  |
| Monthly max   | $100    | Maximum auto-reload spend per month           |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Balance drops below threshold">
    When your credit balance falls below $3 (default), auto-reload activates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Card is charged">
    Your saved payment method is charged $10 (default reload amount)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credits are added">$10 in credits is immediately added to your balance</Step>
  <Step title="Monthly cap enforced">
    Auto-reload stops if you've hit your monthly maximum ($100 default)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### If Auto-Reload is Disabled

When auto-reload is off and your credits run out, you may get an API response like this:

```json
{
  "status": 402,
  "error": "Payment Required",
  "message": "Insufficient credits. Please add credits to continue."
}
```

<Warning>
  If you're running production workloads, we recommend enabling auto-reload to prevent unexpected
  failures.
</Warning>

### Configuring Auto-Reload

You can enable, disable, or adjust auto-reload settings in your [API Dashboard](https://bytez.com/api/billing).

## Auto-Scaling (Open Models)

By default, if you exceed your open model rate limits, requests are rejected with a rate-limit error.

If you want your rate limits to automatically scale with your traffic in production, add `autoScale: true` to your request:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.bytez.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'meta-llama/Llama-3-70b',
    messages: [...],
    autoScale: true
  })
});
```

When enabled, the system auto-purchases extra credits required to keep auto-scaling. You can control your **Max Monthly Spend** in your [API Dashboard](https://bytez.com/api/billing) to cap costs. This way you can auto-scale and control your budget.

<Info>
For closed models, you get unlimited rate limits on a pay-as-you-go basis - no auto-scaling needed.
</Info>

## Billing Cycle

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Free Plan">
    - **Billing:** None
    - **Credits:** {`$1`} free credits, refreshed every 4 weeks
    - **Expiration:** Credits expire 4 weeks after grant
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pay-as-you-go Plan">
    - **Billing:** {`$3/month`} charged on signup date
    - **Credits:** $5 in credits granted each
    billing cycle
    - **Expiration:** All credits expire 4 weeks after grant
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Adding Credits Mid-Cycle

You can add credits at any time. When you do:

1. **Immediate access** - Higher model tiers and rate limits unlock instantly
2. **No proration** - You get the full credit amount immediately
3. **Credits stack** - Purchased credits add to your existing balance

<Info>
  **Example:** You're on `Pay-as-you-go` with {`$2`} remaining. You add {`$25`}. Your new balance is {`$27`},
  which immediately unlocks 70B models and 10 concurrent requests.
</Info>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits mid-request?">
    In-flight requests will complete. Only new requests will fail with a 402 error.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund on unused credits?">
    Credits are non-refundable and expire 4 weeks after purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I track my usage?">
    Visit your [API Dashboard](https://bytez.com/api/billing) to see real-time usage, credit
    balance, and request history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do bigger models require more credits purchased?">
    Larger models require more GPU resources (VRAM). Requiring a minimum purchase threshold ensures
    you have enough credits to complete meaningful workloads without running out mid-task.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there volume pricing?">
    For high-volume usage (>{`$1,000`}/month), contact us at [team@bytez.com](mailto:team@bytez.com) for
