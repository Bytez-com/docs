## Get Your API Key

1. Log into [Bytez](http://bytez.com).
2. Navigate to the `Settings` page.
3. Locate your API key under the **API Keys** section and copy it.

Use this key in the `Authorization` header for all API requests:

```http
Authorization: Key your-key-here
```

## Send Your First API Request
You can use a `curl` command to verify your setup:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.bytez.com/models/v2/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B' \
--header 'Authorization: Key BYTEZ_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You'\''re a helpful assistant"
        },

## Accessing Closed Source Models
Bytez enables you to interact with proprietary [chat](chat/text#proprietary-models) models by `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere`, `Google`, and `Mistral`

To use these models, you'll need two keys:

1. Your `Bytez API Key`: Obtained as described above.
2. `Provider Key`: The key specific to the provider you want to access (e.g., OpenAI API key).

Example Headers
```http
Authorization: Key your-bytez-api-key
Provider-key: your-provider-key
```

## Notes
1. `No Additional Charges`: Bytez does not charge for accessing proprietary models; however, the respective provider's billing applies.
2. `Seamless Integration`: You can interact with closed-source models using the same standardized input structure as open-source models.
