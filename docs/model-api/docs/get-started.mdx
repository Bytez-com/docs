  <Accordion icon='1' title="Install sdk">
    You can use the API with any programming language that can make HTTP requests,
    but we recommend using one of our official SDKs for ease of use and convenience.

    We have libraries for Python, JavaScript, and Julia.
    Using Python 3.9+, JavaScript, or Julia, install the appropriate package:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash javascript
        // use your favorite package manager
        npm i bytez.js
        yarn add bytez.js
      ```

      ```bash python
        pip install bytez
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon='2' title="Auth">
    Bytez allows you to use open-source and closed-source models with a single API key.

    ## Use open-source models

    1. Copy your key from the [API Dashboard](https://bytez.com/api).
    2. Use your Bytez Key in requests

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript javascript
      import Bytez from "bytez.js";

      const sdk = new Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY");
      ```

      ```python python
      from bytez import Bytez

      sdk = Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY")
      ```

      ```bash http
      # add an Authorization header, with value "Key {BYTEZ_KEY}"
      curl -X GET "https://api.bytez.com/models/v2/some-endpoint" \
        -H "Authorization: BYTEZ_KEY"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You're now set to use open source models on Bytez!

    ## Use closed-source models

    To use a closed-source model, you'll need an account with the model provider. For example, if you want to use `OpenAI` models, you'll need an OpenAI key. We call your closed source key a "provider key"

    1. Copy your key from the [API Dashboard](https://bytez.com/api).
    2. Use your Bytez Key AND closed-source provider key in requests.
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash http
      # add a "provider-key" header, and set its value to "{KEY}"
      curl -X GET "https://api.bytez.com/models/v2/some-endpoint" \
        -H "Authorization: BYTEZ_KEY" \
        -H "provider-key: {your-key}"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>


    <Card title="Bytez API Key Security & Usage" icon='lock'>
      We securely route your requests as a pass-through service. Your API keys are never stored or logged by Bytez; they are only used to authenticate directly with the model provider.

      **Recommendation:** Use a dedicated API key for Bytez for maximum security and traceability.

      * **Billing:** No extra Bytez fees for closed-source models; you're billed directly by the provider based on usage associated with your key.
      * **Integration:** Seamlessly use the same input format for all models (open and closed-source).

  <Accordion icon="3" title="Run a model">
      Running is a model is easy. Just select the model and pass it an input

    <CodeGroup>

      ```javascript javascript
      import Bytez from "bytez.js";

      const sdk = new Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY");
      const modelId = "openai-community/gpt-2"
      const model = sdk.model(model_id)

      const { error, output } = await model.run("Once upon a time")

      console.log({ error, output });
      ```

      ```python python
      from bytez import Bytez

      sdk = Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY")

      model = sdk.model("openai-community/gpt-2")

      result = model.run("Once upon a time")

      print(result.output)
      ```

      ```bash http
      curl -X POST "https://api.bytez.com/models/v2/openai-community/gpt-2" \
      -H "Authorization: BYTEZ_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{ "text": "Once upon a time" }'

  <Accordion icon="4" title="List tasks and models">
      You can list all the tasks, models, and running models using the API.

      ### Tasks

      A `task` defines a specific function a model performs (e.g., object-detection). Multiple models might be available for the same task. To list all tasks supported by Bytez, run the following command:

        <CodeGroup>
          ```javascript javascript
          import Bytez from "bytez.js";

          const sdk = new Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY");

          const { error, output } = await sdk.list.tasks()

          console.log({ error, output });
          ```

          ```python python
          from bytez import Bytez

          sdk = Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY")

          result = sdk.list.tasks()

          print(result.output)
          ```

          ```bash http
          curl -X GET "https://api.bytez.com/models/v2/list/tasks" \
            -H "Authorization: BYTEZ_KEY"
          ```

    </CodeGroup>
      ### Models

      A `model` refers to a software function with unique identifier. `Models` execute `tasks`. For example, the model `google/vit-base-patch16-224` executes `image-classification`. To list all open-source models supported by Bytez, run the following command:

          <CodeGroup>
          ```javascript javascript
          import Bytez from "bytez.js";

          const sdk = new Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY");

          const { error, output } = await sdk.list.models()

          console.log({ error, output });
          ```

          ```python python
          from bytez import Bytez

          sdk = Bytez("BYTEZ_KEY")

          result = sdk.list.models()

          print(result.output)
          ```

          ```bash http
          curl -X GET "https://api.bytez.com/models/v2/list/models" \
            -H "Authorization: BYTEZ_KEY"
          ```
